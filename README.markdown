## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Operating System**: Windows (due to the use of `windows.h` for console color manipulation and `conio.h` for functions like `_getch()`).
*   **C++ Compiler**: Any modern C++ compiler that supports C++11 or newer (e.g., g++, MinGW, Clang, MSVC).
*   üìÑ **`utils.h` and `student.h` Header Files (User-Provided)**: This project **critically requires** two header files, `utils.h` and `student.h`, which are **not included in the repository and must be created by the user.** These files should contain necessary utility functions and the student data structure/logic, respectively. See the "Installation and Running" section for more details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Running

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository)

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-directory>` with the name of the cloned folder)

3.  **Create `utils.h` and `student.h`**:
    Before compiling, you **must** create `utils.h` and `student.h` in the project's root directory.

    **Example content for `utils.h` (Illustrative):**
    ```cpp
    #ifndef UTILS_H
    #define UTILS_H

    #include <string>
    #include <windows.h> // For SetConsoleTextAttribute
    #include <conio.h>   // For _getch()
    #include <fstream>   // For logging
    #include <ctime>     // For timestamps in logs

    // Example: Console Color Codes
    const int CLR_DEFAULT = 7;
    const int CLR_MENU = 11;
    const int CLR_HIGHLIGHT = 14;
    const int CLR_ERROR = 12;

    void setColor(int color);
    void drawLine(char c = '-', int length = 50);
    void logError(const std::string& message, const std::string& logFilePath = "errors.log");
    void waitForKeyPress(const std::string& message = "Press any key to continue...");
    // Add other utility function declarations as needed by your main.cpp

    #endif // UTILS_H
    ```

    **Example content for `student.h` (Illustrative):**
    ```cpp
    #ifndef STUDENT_H
    #define STUDENT_H

    #include <string>
    #include <vector> // Assuming dynamic arrays are implemented with vectors

    // Example: Student Data Structure
    struct STUDENT {
        std::string name;
        std::vector<double> grades; // Or a fixed-size array if N_GRADES is constant
        double averageGrade;
        // Add other fields if necessary
    };

    // Function declarations related to student management
    void loadStudentsFromFile(std::vector<STUDENT>& students, const std::string& filePath);
    void saveStudentsToFile(const std::vector<STUDENT>& students, const std::string& filePath);
    void saveBestStudentsToFile(const std::vector<STUDENT>& students, const std::string& filePath, int topN = 3);
    void addStudent(std::vector<STUDENT>& students);
    void removeStudent(std::vector<STUDENT>& students, const std::string& nameToRemove);
    void editStudent(std::vector<STUDENT>& students, const std::string& nameToEdit);
    void displayAllStudents(const std::vector<STUDENT>& students);
    void calculateAverageGrades(std::vector<STUDENT>& students); // Calculates for all and individual
    void findBestStudents(const std::vector<STUDENT>& students);
    STUDENT* searchStudent(std::vector<STUDENT>& students, const std::string& searchTerm);
    void modifyGrades(STUDENT* student); // For a specific student
    void generateRandomGrades(STUDENT& student, int numGrades = 5, double minGrade = 2.0, double maxGrade = 5.0);
    // Add other student-related function declarations

    #endif // STUDENT_H
    ```
    *These are **examples**. You need to implement the functions declared here (either in these .h files if they are simple inline functions/templates, or more commonly in corresponding `.cpp` files like `utils.cpp` and `student.cpp` which you would then also need to compile and link).*

4.  **Compile the Program**:
    Open a terminal (like Command Prompt or PowerShell) in the project directory.
    **Example using g++ (MinGW):**
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp utils.cpp student.cpp -o student_management.exe -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
    ```
    *(This assumes you have `utils.cpp` and `student.cpp` for implementations. If all logic is in headers, then `g++ main.cpp -o student_management.exe ...` might suffice, but this is less common for larger projects).*

5.  **Prepare `data.txt` (Optional but Recommended)**:
    You can pre-populate a file named `data.txt` (or whatever your primary data file is named, potentially defined in `utils.h` or a new `constants.h`) with student names, one per line. If the file doesn't exist, the program might be designed to create it or prompt for initial data.

6.  **Run the Application**:
    After successful compilation, execute the generated program:
    ```bash
    ./student_management.exe
    ```
    or simply in CMD:
    ```bash
    student_management.exe
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

Upon launching, the application will present a main menu with numbered options. Enter the number corresponding to your desired action:

1.  **Display all students**: Lists all students currently in the system along with their grades and average.
2.  **Show average grades**: Displays the overall class average and individual student averages.
3.  **Find best students**: Identifies and shows the top-performing students (e.g., top 3 by average grade). This list might also be saved to `best_students.txt`.
4.  **Search for a student**: Allows you to search for a student by name (case-insensitive, partial matches often supported).
5.  **Modify grades**: Select a student and manually change their grades or trigger random grade generation for them.
6.  **Add new student**: Prompts for the new student's name and initializes their record (possibly with empty or randomly generated grades).
7.  **Remove student**: Allows you to select and delete a student's record from the system.
8.  **Edit student**: Allows modification of a student's details (e.g., name).
9.  **Exit**: Saves data (if applicable) and terminates the application.

*Data is typically saved to `data.txt` upon exiting or via a dedicated save option, and top student lists might be updated in `best_students.txt`.*

## üí° Technical Details & Program Logic

*   **Dynamic Data Structures**: Uses dynamic arrays (likely `std::vector` in C++) to store student records, allowing for a variable number of students.
*   **`STUDENT` Structure/Class**: Defined in `student.h`, this holds individual student data like name, a collection of grades, and calculated average.
*   **`utils.h`**: Contains utility functions such as `setColor()` for console colors, `drawLine()` for UI formatting, `logError()` for writing to an error log, and `waitForKeyPress()` for pausing execution.
*   **File I/O**: Employs C++ file streams (`fstream`) to read and write student data to `data.txt` and `best_students.txt`. The format can be plain text or a more structured format.
*   **Grade Generation**: Random grades (e.g., floating-point numbers between 2.0 and 5.0) are generated using C++'s random number utilities.
*   **Search Algorithm**: Implements a search function (e.g., linear search) that can handle partial and case-insensitive name matching.
*   **Error Handling**: Basic error logging, for instance, if data files cannot be opened.
